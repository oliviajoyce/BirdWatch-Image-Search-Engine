# Image-Search-Engine
An Image Search Engine for Bird Watching Enthusiasts. Images are sourced from Wikipedia using a python web scraper. A textual surrogate is created which contains HTML and computer vision annotations for each image. This allows for easy retrieval and ranking using BM25 and VSM. User interface was created using Flask and Bootstrap.
